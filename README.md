### Validation

On code completion, I ensured my code was validated with no snytax errors. I used [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for HTML5, [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for CSS3 to ensure my code is W3C Compliant. I used [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) to helps to detect errors and potential problems in your JavaScript code.

## Deployment

The project was deployed to Github Pages using the following method:

1.  Log into Github and found the [Project Repository](#)
1.  At the top of the Repository, i clicked the "[Settings](#)" option on the menu.
1.  I scrolled down the page until i found "Github Pages" section.
1.  Under the "Source" section, a drop-down option with the result of "None" is visible. I clicked on the drop-down option and selected "Master Brand".
1.  The page would automatically refresh itself to the top of the page.
1.  I scrolled down to 'Github Pages' again and found a published link which is my deployed site URL.

### Making a Clone

To make a clone, I had to get the SSH key from the repository which allowed me to clone the repository to my local hard drive.

#### Method 1: (mostly used)

Within brackets (Editing tool), I was able to download a plugin which enabled me to connect brackets to my GitHub repository. Whenever code was created and saved, I was given the option to commit and make notes on the upload. Once completed, I was able to push the changes to GitHub.

#### Method 2: Github Desktop

The alternative method which I used when I first started the project was [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). I was able to connect my Github repository and push my files through that method. I eventually stopped as the plugin within my code editor did the same job. This enabled me to have one less application to have running while developing.
